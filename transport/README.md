# :transport — the bridge seam (SMS-1, SMS-2)

Pure Kotlin/JVM module holding the InkStax SMS layer's one
bridge seam. SMS-1 extracted the outbound side; SMS-2 adds the
inbound side with its local binding first.

## What lives here

- `MessageTransport` — the single outbound interface every
  transport binding of the bridge seam implements (director
  round 4: ONE bridge seam, three transport bindings — local /
  host / cloud-as-design-intent). Plain value types only.
- `outboundChannel` — the SMS-vs-MMS routing decision, extracted
  unchanged from the app's send entry point so local mode uses
  the same decision the seam exposes.
- `InboundSink` + `InboundSms` + `inboundDispositionFor` — the
  inbound side of the seam (SMS-2). The disposition rule is
  shared by every binding: SMS text is handled, MMS is
  NOT_FORWARDED in V1 (surfaced, never silently dropped), and a
  blank sender is deferred. `InboundSms.sourceId` renders the
  provider row id in the bridge contract's shape
  ("sms:<id>" / "mms:<id>").

## Invariants

- **GMS-free, Android-free.** This module depends on the Kotlin
  standard library only (JUnit for its tests). The local-mode
  build's GMS-free invariant is structural here.
- **No bridge protocol yet.** No wire format, no ack/heartbeat
  state, no network transport, no endpoint or credential
  material. The local binding is in-process; host/cloud bindings
  stay design-intent until their own slices open.
- **No second intake, store, or scheduler.** Receivers persist
  through the existing provider/app store first; the seam only
  classifies and hands off.
- **V1 is SMS text only.** MMS sending stays on the existing
  app-side path; inbound MMS is classified NOT_FORWARDED.

## App-side binding

The local bindings live in the app under
`org.fossify.messages.transport`: `LocalMessageTransport`
(outbound, delegates to the fork's existing SMS
persistence/sending code, error codes unchanged) and
`LocalInboundSink` (inbound, applies the shared disposition
rule after local persistence).

## Upstream touchpoint registry (SMS-1, ≤5, tagged in code)

| # | File | Change |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | `app/src/main/kotlin/org/fossify/messages/messaging/Messaging.kt` | Send entry point routes via `outboundChannel` and sends SMS via `MessageTransport`; file shrinks under the code-shape ratchet |
| 2 | `settings.gradle.kts` | `include(":transport")` |
| 3 | `app/build.gradle.kts` | `implementation(project(":transport"))` |
| 4 | `gradle/libs.versions.toml` | `kotlinJvm` plugin alias + JUnit test dependency |
| 5 | `build.gradle.kts` (root) | `kotlinJvm` plugin declared `apply(false)` |

## Upstream touchpoint registry (SMS-2, ≤5, tagged in code)

| # | File | Change |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | `app/src/main/kotlin/org/fossify/messages/receivers/SmsReceiver.kt` | After local persistence + notification, inbound SMS passes through `LocalInboundSink` with its provider row id |
| 2 | `app/src/main/kotlin/org/fossify/messages/receivers/MmsReceiver.kt` | MMS arrivals pass through `LocalInboundSink` so V1 classifies them NOT_FORWARDED; a NOT_FORWARDED outcome is surfaced to the user with the `mms_not_forwarded` toast |
| 3 | `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` | One new string, `mms_not_forwarded`, for that surfacing |

Everything else in these slices is new files (this module and
the app-side `org.fossify.messages.transport` package) — no
other upstream file is modified.
